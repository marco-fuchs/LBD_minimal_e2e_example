# LBD_minimal_e2e_example

Goal: 
- Read objects and their properties defined in an object type library (OTL) from IFC into RDF
- Create an IDS based on the constraints in the OTL to validate the IFC
- Validate the RDF data read from the IFC using the definition in the OTL with SHACL

Uses Python with the package [IfcOpenShell](https://docs.ifcopenshell.org/ifcopenshell-python/hello_world.html).
